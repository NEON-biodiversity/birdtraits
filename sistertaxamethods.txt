Methodology for sister taxa:

1. Pull all vertnet records for mammals that have body mass measured.
2. Find genera that have multiple species with at least 5 body mass records.
3. Find the median latitude of all the records for each species.
4. Find pairs within genera in which the lower-latitude species is tropical (|lat| < 23.5) and the higher-latitude species is not tropical (|lat| > 23.5).
	*** There are 15 such pairs with adequate number of records.
5. Calculate the coefficient of variation of log10(mass) for each species.
6. Run a paired one-sided t-test going from the hypothesis that the tropical species will have lower CV.

Ideas for covariates to test in birds or ways to refine the analysis:

1. migrant status
2. some type of phylogenetic correction
3. functional group (songbird, raptor, etc)
4. old versus new world
5. range size, or home range size
6. latitudinal distance between the taxa
7. location of specimen inside the species' range (is it a core or an edge individual?)
8. correct so that the pairs truly do represent sister species (instead of just two congeners)
